## What is this project?

This project is a way of students delivery homeworks as zip file to a central folder.

The folder is structure as class, project and student name. E.g. Class-02/HelloWorld/Leo

The zip files are delivered from the stored students using a token that link the student name and the project.

The Token can be generated by the admin of the portal and delivered by e-mail(or other security channel) to each student.

The ideia is that each student have a token to delivered a specific project, the token should be unic for that delivered.
